# Aletha Health Exercise App

A simple mobile exercise app built with Flutter and Bloc for Aletha Health. It helps users follow and complete exercises conveniently, promoting physical wellbeing by reducing pain and tightness.

## üöÄ Features

- Fetches exercises from a REST API
- Displays exercise name, duration, description, and difficulty
- Start timer for the duration of an exercise
- Marks exercises as completed upon finishing
- Completed exercises are shown with a green badge
- Clean and responsive UI
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Organized and maintainable codebase using Bloc for state management

## üß± Architecture

This app follows a basic layered architecture:

- **Models**: Represent data objects (`Exercise`)
- **Repository**: Handles API requests (`ExerciseRepository`)
- **Bloc**: Manages app state (`ExerciseBloc`, `ExerciseEvent`, `ExerciseState`)
- **UI**: Contains screens and widgets (`HomeScreen`, `DetailScreen`, `ExerciseTile`)
- **Routing**: Uses simple `Navigator.push` for navigation

## üì± Screens

- **Home Screen**: Shows pending and completed exercises
- **Detail Screen**: Displays detailed information about an exercise and includes a Start button
- **Timer Screen** *(if added)*: Runs a timer for the exercise duration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Shortcomings

- Completion status is currently stored only in memory and is reset when the app is restarted
- UI could be enhanced using Figma-based design
- No persistent streak/progress tracker yet (planned as optional feature)
